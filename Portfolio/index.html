            <p style="padding-bottom: 12px;"> A 18 years old student, inhabited in Neuburg an der Donau.
                In my free time, I enjoy working on software and hardware of computers with great enthusiasm. In the past few years I was able to acquire extensive knowledge about the installation and removal of hardware components as well as the operation of operating systems and user software.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 12px;"> In order to learn even more about IT, I fervently read specialist literature from the Munich library, for example a book about Numerical Algebar

                In terms of my learning method & pattern I do tend to rigorously follow the <a class="cool-link" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Blooms taxnomiy</a>, which has proved significantly great for me as it lays out a framework for understanding the different levels of learning, and thus profoundly and substantially explaining the comprehensivity of each level.

          <p>According to the old saying from Confucius, “To know what you know and what you do not know, that is true knowledge.” Reflection is an act that helps you better determine your own true knowledge about something. For me personally, acknowledging my limitations or what I don’t understand about certain material is the key to real learning. Without such practices, it isn’t really learning at all. Inversely, I strive to better and honestly understand my strengths, as well as my growth and progress.</p>

          <p>My journey with programming began actually at its very root. I started by taking the CS50 course, which is an on-campus and simultaneously an online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University. When I accomplished this course I have gained a <b>profound understanding about the Computer & its Digital fundaments and usage </b>, which I would advise everyone to start off with.</p>

          <p>Following the CS50 course I started to create my very first projects with my first programming language C++, that to a great degree allowed me to fundamentally understand the computation steps performed by a compiler, afterward I also convert my code into Python language, thus <b>creating various Algorithms & Data structures</b>.</p></a>

          <p>As soon as the program fulfills its premise of giving the result to the user, I always have seeked to present the output to the user in a user-friendly manner, and therefore started with Web-development by reading the MDN-document by mozilla. Soon after I have also acquired a nice <b>in-sight of back-end & front-end development</b> and have worked a little bit on some web-frameworks, like React for SPAs & Laravel for MPAs, which simultaneously has also let me familiarize with the Model-view-controller pattern.</p></a>

          <p>A network engineer is responsible for planning, designing, and deploying network infrastructure, which is an inevitable supplement, either for small or big industry & companies nowadays.

          <p>IT security nowadays is just an essentiality for everyone, and yet it is the most vulnerable and fragile aspect of the digital world. In 2020 I have begun my voyage and ever since I am continuously learning about it to a great extent, by now I have had a closer look on each operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), as well as Virtual machines and am currently occupied, to <b>understand operating systems in-depth</b>, at least as far as the basic and intermediate level is concerned. Afterwards I intend to seek to familiarize myself with the ethical hacking profession & penetration techniques and how to encouter them, especially in face of erraning issue it has became due to the pandemic.</p>

            <p>Chat messaging is everywhere today. We contact customer support personnel through a web app for organization purposes. We interact with our friends & family, no matter where we are. Many of messaging apps have ocurred, for many cases, however, you still may need to create <b>your own real-time chat app</b> in order to reach to a particular audience, like school or company. For this very purpose I have created my own secure chat app on React, which has implemented managed services to purly focus on building the app in the first place, and leaving the concern of server management and scaling to the provider.</p>

          <div class="topic">Euler Problems</div>
          <p>This piece of code was created in an attempt to solve the mathematically wide known Euler problems, which by its definition is <b>a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs nowadays</b>, on which I also tried my best to solve. In my terminal interface program written in C#, I was able to solve several problems starting chronologically, thus was able to disentangle 14 of the above mentioned problems on my own, which gained me an in-depth look into how numerical mathematical operations are actually performed by computers. As you can see in my repository on Github this project is to a great extend rigourly in terms of hierarchy structure based on C# project structure, on which I also got a closer look while I was working on this particularly project. In addition, the whole project is still in work, since weekly I am trying to solve and profoundly understand further mathematical problems, which are actually a lot of.</p>

          <p>Although I originally started with R studio, as I was working on this particular data set, I eventually also implied my ideas in Python (Pandas). The initial project on R is actually uploaded into my kaggle account "lyffski" and thus took part in the legendary Titanic competitions. So thorough my script in R I went over the most important aspect of Machine Learning process, like <b>Classification, Exploratory Modeling (caret library), Cross Validation, ggplots, Sensitivity and specificity of postive & negative True/False rate, Random forest</b> and ultimately <b>Predictions</b> based on my script and thus finally a Submission for the competitions on kaggle, I personally found A.I. materia really fascinating, and am certain, that it surely won't be my last time with working on A.I. and computer based predictions with random forest, especially since <b>the market-grow for AI spezialist does tend to grow at really huge scale</b>, so I could very well image that on one day I would like to truly specialize in this fascinating profession of A.I.</p>

          <p>Program have been build for a path finding visualizer tool to visualize the astar pathfinding algorithm as it runs. This <b>astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is substantially more efficient</b> than the standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search and <b>uses significantly less CPU resources</b>, then elsewise. In addition the whole GUI was build with PyGames library, which gives the plane a neat look, fancy colors and some cool animation.</p>
